                <h2>Beshbarmak – The Heart of Kazakh Cuisine</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Beshbarmak</strong>, which means “five fingers” in Kazakh, 
                    is the national dish of Kazakhstan and a symbol of hospitality and unity. 
                    Traditionally, it is prepared with boiled meat—most often lamb, beef, 
                    or horse meat—served over a bed of flat pasta-like noodles and accompanied 
                    by a rich onion broth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For centuries, beshbarmak has held a special place in Kazakh culture. 
                    It is not only a meal but also a ritual, often served during important 
                    celebrations, family gatherings, and festivals. Eating it with the hands, 
                    as the name suggests, reflects the nomadic traditions of the Kazakh people, 
                    emphasizing closeness, trust, and shared joy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, beshbarmak continues to be a proud expression of Kazakhstan’s heritage. 
                    More than just food, it represents respect for guests, deep cultural values, 
                    and the enduring spirit of the Kazakh people.
